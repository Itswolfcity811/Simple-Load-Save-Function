# Simple Load and Save Functions
I made a few functions to load and save data, I can't test it right now but I'm pretty sure that it works. It was made for LÃ–VE2d, I think that it should work for anything else. If you make any changes to it on your side then make a pull request and I will look at it. Please let me know if you find any issues.

If you use the functions please have a link to this repository somewhere on the selling page of the software.
